summary: |-
    KEG worklog and documentation for the "tapper" project. Use this keg as
    the canonical place for project notes, Zekia prompt contexts, and generated
    indices that drive tooling and automation for the repo.

    Key points:
    - Contains documentation and contexts consumed by the Zekia utility (see
      zekia.includes.docs which discovers **/meta.yaml and merges contexts/roles).
    - Provides autogenerated indices (dex/changes.md, dex/nodes.tsv, dex/links,
      dex/backlinks, dex/tags) used by keg tooling for fast lookups and hub pages.
    - Keep the updated line as the first line; update it when you change content
      or metadata so indexers detect changes.
    - Keep the zero node as a placeholder for planned content and update creator
      and url to reflect the keg's primary repo/location.
