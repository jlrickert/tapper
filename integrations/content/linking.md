# Linking conventions

Tapper supports two link forms in node bodies:

- **Intra-keg:** `[title](../NODEID)` — relative path from the current node's
  directory to the target node's directory. Renders as a link in markdown
  tooling and is resolvable by the index.
- **Cross-keg (configured):** `[title](keg:ALIAS/NODEID)` — resolves the keg
  through active configuration and is parsed by the index into a cross-keg
  edge.
- **Cross-keg (fully qualified):**
  `[title](keg:@NAMESPACE/ALIAS/NODEID)` — identifies the namespace and keg
  explicitly and is parsed into a cross-keg edge.

Both forms appear in backlinks. Prefer intra-keg links when the target is in
the same keg. A bare `keg:` reference in node prose is plain text: it does not
create a graph link or backlink. Bare references remain valid as CLI arguments,
configuration values, schema values, and tool parameters.

## Attachments

A node's uploaded files and images live in two directories inside the node's
own directory, so they are linked relative to it — the same base the `../NODEID`
form above counts from:

- **File:** `[label](./assets/FILE)` — anything uploaded with
  `mcp__tapper__upload_file`.
- **Image:** `![alt](./images/IMAGE)` — anything uploaded with
  `mcp__tapper__upload_image`.

**Both directory names are plural**: `assets/` and `images/`, never `asset/` or
`image/`. Uploading succeeds regardless of how you later write the link, so a
singular path fails silently as a broken reference rather than as an error.

Use `mcp__tapper__list_files` and `mcp__tapper__list_images` to get the exact
stored names; the upload may normalize the filename you supplied.
