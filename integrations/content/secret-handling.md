# Secret handling

## Secret handling

- Never store credentials, API tokens, private keys, session cookies, customer
  secrets, or unredacted sensitive production data in a KEG.
- Do not paste secrets into node content, metadata, links, snapshots, files, or
  images. Snapshot history is durable and does not make secret storage safe.
- When evidence contains sensitive values, record a redacted description and a
  safe reference to the authorized system that owns the secret.
- If a secret is discovered in a KEG, stop before copying or editing it further
  and follow the user's incident and credential-rotation process.
