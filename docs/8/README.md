# Changes index - `dex/changes.md`

This file is a human-readable [index](../6) of recent changes across the [KEG](../5) docs. It is intended as a quick changelog for readers and a convenient place for tooling or humans to glance at recent updates.

## Purpose

- Provide a compact, chronological list of recent document/node updates.
- Give links to the updated node/docs for quick navigation.
- Serve as an easy-to-scan single-file changelog for the KEG instance.

## Location

- Typically stored at dex/changes.md in the repository layout.

## Format

- Plain Markdown list (one bullet per change).
- Each entry is a single line with three parts:

  1. ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (ending with Z)
  2. A title describing the changed node/document
  3. A relative Markdown link to the node/document

- Example entry:
  - 2025-08-09 18:12:52Z [Keg configuration (keg-config)](../2)

## Semantics

- Timestamp: When the node or document was last updated. Use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ) in UTC to ensure consistent ordering and parsing.
- Title: Human-readable title for the node. May include a short slug in parentheses for convenience (e.g., "(keg-config)").
- Link: Relative link to the node or documentation file (usually a parent-level reference like ../2 for node id 2 or a path to a doc).

## Sorting and ordering

- Entries are normally listed in descending chronological order (newest first). This makes the top of the file show the most recent changes.
- If generated by tooling, the generator should sort by the timestamp.

## Maintenance

- Prefer automated updates from the KEG indexer/tooling (for example, `keg index update`) rather than manual edits.
- If you must edit by hand:
  - Ensure timestamps are valid ISO 8601 UTC and placed at the beginning of the line.
  - Keep the line format intact to avoid breaking scripts that may parse this file.
  - Append new entries at the top (or re-sort after adding) so newest entries remain first.

## Usage

- Human readers use this as a changelog.
- Scripts and tools can parse the file to:
  - Produce release notes
  - Drive a “recent changes” panel or RSS feed
  - Cross-reference nodes that changed in a time window

## Parsing tips for tooling

- Treat each line beginning with an asterisk or dash as a candidate entry.
- Split the line into:
  - leading timestamp (match ISO 8601 UTC)
  - a bracketed title: [Title]
  - a parenthetical link: (../N) or (path/to/doc)
- Validate timestamps and normalize to UTC if required.

## Best practices

- Keep titles short and descriptive.
- Include a slug in parentheses only if it helps automated or human lookup.
- Use automated index generation where possible to avoid drift and timestamp mistakes.
- If your process needs machine-readable change metadata, consider keeping a parallel structured index (JSON, TSV) alongside this human-readable file.
