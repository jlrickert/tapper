title:   KEG Worklog for tapper
url:     https://keg.jlrickert.me/@jlrickert/tapper
creator: git@github.com:jlrickert/jlrickert.git
state:   living

summary: |
  KEG worklog and documentation for the "tapper" project. Use this keg as
  the canonical place for project notes, Zeke prompt contexts, and generated
  indices that drive tooling and automation for the repo.

  Key points:
  - Contains documentation and contexts consumed by the Zeke utility (see
    zeke.includes.docs which discovers **/meta.yaml and merges contexts/roles).
  - Provides autogenerated indices (dex/changes.md, dex/nodes.tsv, dex/links,
    dex/backlinks, dex/tags) used by keg tooling for fast lookups and hub pages.
  - Keep the `updated` line as the first line; update it when you change content
    or metadata so indexers detect changes.
  - Keep the zero node as a placeholder for planned content and update `creator`
    and `url` to reflect the keg's primary repo/location.
